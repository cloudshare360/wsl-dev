# now guide me how to start full ubuntu ui

To start a **full Ubuntu desktop UI** (not just single apps) in WSL2, you need to use either a **Remote Desktop (RDP)** solution or an external X server. WSLg is optimized for running individual GUI apps; it does not natively support a complete, cohesive desktop shell like a VM does. Here’s the best method for your needs:

***

## Method: Full Ubuntu Desktop (XFCE) via xRDP

1. **Install XFCE Desktop and xRDP:**

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install xfce4 xrdp -y
```

2. **Set XFCE as the default session:**

```bash
echo xfce4-session > ~/.xsession
```

3. **Restart the xrdp service:**

```bash
sudo service xrdp restart
```

4. **Check xrdp status (optional debug):**

```bash
systemctl status xrdp
```

5. **Get your WSL IP address:**

```bash
hostname -I
```

(or, if not installed: `sudo apt install net-tools && ifconfig`)
6. **Connect using Windows Remote Desktop:**
    - Open **Remote Desktop Connection** (`mstsc.exe`) on Windows.
    - Enter the WSL IP address (from `hostname -I`).
    - Login with your Linux username and password.
    - You should see and interact with the **full XFCE desktop UI**—complete desktop, panel, workspace switcher, file manager, etc..[^1][^2][^3]

***

### Notes and Best Practices

- Each time you restart WSL, the WSL IP may change. So, run `hostname -I` before connecting.
- For best results, use **XFCE** as your session type. GNOME/KDE may require tweaks for xrdp.
- You can close the RDP window at any time and continue working later—your Linux desktop session is persistent as long as the WSL instance is running.

***

### What About WSLg?

- WSLg is for launching **individual apps** (e.g., `thunar`, `xfce4-terminal`) which appear as native Windows windows.
- **Full “desktop” mode** (desktop wallpaper, panels, etc.) is intentionally NOT supported by WSLg—it focuses on seamless app integration.
- If you want a “real” desktop as with a VM or native Ubuntu, use the RDP method above.

***

**Summary:**
Use the **xRDP method with XFCE** for the closest VM-style full Ubuntu UI, or launch apps individually with WSLg for a more “integrated” Windows-Linux experience.
