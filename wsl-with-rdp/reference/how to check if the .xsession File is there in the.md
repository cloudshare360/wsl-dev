# how to check if the .xsession File is there in the root

To check if the `.xsession` file exists in your home directory (not root), run this command in your WSL terminal:

```bash
ls -l ~/.xsession
```

- If the file exists, you’ll see its details (permissions, date, etc.).
- If it does **not** exist, you’ll get a message like:
`ls: cannot access '/home/youruser/.xsession': No such file or directory`

***

**Note:**

- The **home directory** is usually `/home/yourusername/`, not `/root/` (unless you are running as the root user, which is rarely the case for desktop environments).
- If you want to check in the **root** user’s directory (not recommended for desktop/RDP sessions), you would run:

```bash
ls -l /root/.xsession
```

But for your normal user desktop, use `~/.xsession` as shown above.

If you need to create or edit the file, let me know!
