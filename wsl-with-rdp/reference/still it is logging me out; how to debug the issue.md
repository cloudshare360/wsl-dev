# still it is logging me out; how to debug the issue

Here are targeted steps to **debug xRDP logging you out or showing a blank screen on Ubuntu XFCE with WSL2**:

***

### 1. **Check and Share xRDP and Session Logs**

**After attempting to connect via RDP, run the following in your WSL terminal:**

```bash
tail -n 40 /var/log/xrdp.log
tail -n 40 /var/log/xrdp-sesman.log
tail -n 40 ~/.xsession-errors
```

- These logs often show why the session is failing or closing.
- Look for “error”, “fail”, or “permission denied” messages.

***

### 2. **Check for Running Sessions**

If your user is logged in elsewhere in WSL, xRDP may refuse a second GUI session. Run:

```bash
who
ps aux | grep xfce
ps aux | grep Xorg
ps aux | grep xrdp
```

- If you see another XFCE session or desktop process, log it out or kill it.

***

### 3. **Confirm startwm.sh Editing**

**View the full top section of `/etc/xrdp/startwm.sh`** to ensure it starts like this:

```bash
unset DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS
unset XDG_RUNTIME_DIR

if [ -r /etc/X11/Xsession ]; then
  exec /etc/X11/Xsession
fi
exec /bin/sh /etc/X11/Xsession
```

- Only `unset`—no custom commands or accidental syntax changes.
- Don’t remove the original script content, just add the `unset` lines at the top!

***

### 4. **Permissions Check**

Check permissions and ownership:

```bash
ls -l /etc/xrdp/startwm.sh
ls -l ~/.xsession
```

Both should be readable and executable.

***

### 5. **Restart All Relevant Services**

After any config change, run:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart xrdp
sudo systemctl restart xrdp-sesman
```


***

### 6. **Try a Clean RDP Session**

Close all open WSL terminals and then connect again via RDP.
Make sure there are **no other RDP connections or Linux desktop apps** running.

***

### 7. **Try Alternative Session Setup**

As a test, create/update `.xsessionrc` in your home directory:

```bash
echo "xfce4-session" > ~/.xsessionrc
```


***

### 8. **Check RDP Resolution**

Try lowering the resolution/disable bitmap caching in your RDP client for troubleshooting.

***

### 9. **Systemd Note**

On modern Ubuntu/WSL2, if you’ve enabled systemd in `/etc/wsl.conf`, try toggling it off just for testing:

```ini
[boot]
systemd=false
```

`wsl --shutdown && wsl`

***

**If you share the last 40 lines of `xrdp.log`, `xrdp-sesman.log`, and `.xsession-errors`, I can help analyze the exact cause and expedite the fix!** Let me know what you find.
