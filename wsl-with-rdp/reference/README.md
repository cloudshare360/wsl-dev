sudo systemctl status xrdp

# View logs for troubleshooting
tail -n 20 /var/log/xrdp.log
tail -n 20 ~/.xsession-errors
```

### Connection Steps
1. Get WSL IP: `hostname -I`
2. Open Remote Desktop Connection (`mstsc.exe`) on Windows
3. Connect to WSL IP address
4. Login with Linux username/password
