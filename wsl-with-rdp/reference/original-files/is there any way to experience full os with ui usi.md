# is there any way to experience full os with ui using wsl environment

Yes, you can experience a **full Linux desktop with user interface (UI)** inside a WSL environment, especially with **WSL 2** and **WSLg** (Windows Subsystem for Linux GUI). While WSL is not a full hypervisor like VirtualBox or VMware, modern WSL builds allow near-native Linux desktop environments to run inside Windows.[^1][^5][^6]

### Two Main Options

#### 1. Using WSLg (Built-in GUI Support)

Windows 11 and newer Windows 10 builds include **WSLg**, which natively supports Linux graphical applications (X11 and Wayland).
You can:

- Launch GUI apps (like Firefox, Gedit, or VS Code) directly from your Linux terminal.
- Find Linux apps in the Windows Start menu.
- Use Alt+Tab between Linux and Windows apps seamlessly.[^1]

This does not give you a full Linux desktop session (like GNOME or KDE), but it allows graphical applications to integrate directly into Windows.

#### 2. Running a Full Desktop Environment

You can also set up a **complete Linux desktop environment** within WSL using tools like `tasksel` or a manual setup.
Typical desktop options include:

- GNOME
- KDE Plasma
- XFCE
- Cinnamon

**Steps (Example using Ubuntu on WSL2):**

1. Update and install dependencies:

```
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install tasksel dbus-x11 xauth
```

2. Launch Tasksel and choose your preferred DE:

```
sudo tasksel
```

3. Install an X server or use RDP to access the Linux desktop from Windows:
    - For X server: install **VcXsrv** or **X410** on Windows.
    - For RDP: run `sudo apt install xrdp` and connect via Windows Remote Desktop.[^3][^5][^9]

This enables a full OS-like graphical session similar to running Ubuntu, KDE, or Fedora directly, but backed by the WSL2 kernel.

### Practical Recommendation

For best performance:

- Use **WSL2** with latest Windows build and GPU acceleration support.
- Prefer lightweight desktops like **XFCE** or **LXQt** instead of GNOME on lower-resource systems.[^5][^8]

In essence, WSL2 with WSLg provides **native Linux GUI support**, and adding a desktop environment transforms it into a **complete OS-like experience** without requiring dual-booting or full virtualization.[^6][^9][^5][^1]
