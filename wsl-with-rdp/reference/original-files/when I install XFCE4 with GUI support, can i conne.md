# when I install XFCE4 with GUI support, can i connect to ubuntu with GUI interface? like normal  ubuntu ui

Yes, after installing **XFCE4** (or a similar desktop) with GUI support in WSL2, you can connect and use **Ubuntu with a full desktop interface** that behaves much like a native Ubuntu session — though with a few limitations due to WSL’s architecture compared to a full hypervisor or dual-boot environment.

### How It Feels in Practice

When properly configured, the XFCE4 environment on WSL2 launches into a graphical session that includes:

- A desktop with panels, menus, and workspace switching (similar to Ubuntu’s XFCE variants like *Xubuntu*);
- File manager (Thunar), terminal, browser, and app launcher;
- Mouse, keyboard shortcuts, and GPU-accelerated graphics via WSLg integration.[^1][^2][^3]


### Types of GUI Experiences

#### 1. Integrated Ubuntu UI with WSLg (Recommended)

If you're on **Windows 11 or Windows 10 (22H2+)**, WSLg provides native support for both X11 and Wayland, so once XFCE is installed, you can easily launch a full UI via:

```bash
dbus-launch startxfce4
```

Each window (for Thunar, Terminal, Settings) opens seamlessly alongside Windows applications.
This provides a **native Ubuntu GUI experience** inside Windows without manual X servers.[^4][^5]

#### 2. Classic Remote Desktop (XRDP)

If you specifically want to load **Ubuntu’s full session** — with login screen, consistent panels, and all UI features — you can install **xRDP** to connect through Remote Desktop Client.
This setup replicates the normal Ubuntu desktop and lets you log in just like you would on real hardware:

```bash
sudo apt install xrdp -y
sudo systemctl enable xrdp
sudo systemctl start xrdp
```

Then connect via:

```
mstsc -> localhost:3389
```

This method offers a stable, full-session UI similar to Ubuntu Desktop, especially when paired with the XFCE interface for resource efficiency.[^6][^3]

#### 3. X410 or VcXsrv (Optional)

You can also use external X servers like X410 or VcXsrv to open an Ubuntu-like desktop in a dedicated window, useful if WSLg performance is inconsistent.[^2][^7]

### Realistic Limitations

Even though XFCE or LXQt desktops look and behave very close to Ubuntu’s official desktop editions:

- You won’t get a full **LightDM or GDM login screen**;
- System-level operations (e.g., GPU settings manager, suspend/resume) are restricted;
- WSL is containerized, so kernel/module management is limited.[^8][^9]


### Recommendation

For **maximum stability and usability**:

- Use **Ubuntu 24.04 or 22.04 LTS** on WSL2.
- Enable **systemd** in `/etc/wsl.conf`.
- Use **XFCE4 via WSLg** for smoothest integration.
- Use **xRDP** connection only if you want a complete desktop shell with session persistence.

This setup effectively gives you the **Ubuntu Desktop experience** — including file browsing, GUI editing, and app management — while keeping resource usage low and stability high.[^3][^4][^2]
