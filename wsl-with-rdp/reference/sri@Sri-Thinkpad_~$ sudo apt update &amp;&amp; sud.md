Your commands installed **XFCE4** and all related packages correctly—your package lists are up to date and there are no upgrade issues.
However, the **error messages** you’re seeing indicate that the graphical desktop could not start properly because of a **display environment issue**:

### Key Errors in Your Output

- `cannot open display: wayland-0`
- `Unable to open display from environment variable DISPLAY='wayland-0', exiting.`
- `Can't open display: wayland-0`
- Gtk/Polkit/XFCE4 cannot connect to proper X11 or Wayland display

***

### Why This Happens

1. **WSLg auto-handles GUI sessions.**
    - If you are using WSLg (Windows 11, WSL2 with GUI support), there is no need to launch the desktop directly via `startxfce4`.
    - Only run individual GUI apps (e.g., `thunar`, `xfce4-terminal`), and WSLg will open them in Windows.
2. **Attempting to launch a full desktop shell** (`startxfce4`) directly tries to claim the default system display (`:0` or `wayland-0`), which is already managed by WSLg, and this causes the display environment error.

***

### How To Fix/Optimize

#### 1. **Check your environment variable for DISPLAY:**

Inside your WSL Ubuntu shell, run:

```bash
echo $DISPLAY
```

- With WSLg, it should automatically be set (typically to something like `:0`).
- If not using WSLg (e.g., Windows 10), you'll need to configure an X server and set DISPLAY.


#### 2. **Launch GUI apps individually**

Instead of launching the full XFCE desktop with `startxfce4`, simply run:

```bash
xfce4-terminal &
thunar &
mousepad &
```

Each will open in Windows natively.

#### 3. **If you want full desktop session:**

- You need to install **xRDP** or use an external X server (like X410, VcXsrv), then connect via Windows Remote Desktop.
This gives you the login, panels, and workspace switching typical of a full Ubuntu install.


#### 4. **Check if WSLg is running:**

Open any GUI app (e.g., `gedit`, `thunar`). If it opens in a new window on your Windows desktop, WSLg is active.

***

### Next Steps

- **Best practice for cloud development on WSL2**: Use VS Code, terminal, and individual GUI apps (file manager, browser) rather than launching the desktop like a full VM.
- If you need the complete desktop environment, set up **xRDP + XFCE** or external X server integration, not via `startxfce4` on WSLg.

***

**Summary:**
Your packages and desktop are installed correctly. For optimal integration, launch GUI apps individually with WSLg. For a full desktop experience, use xRDP or X server tools. The errors are not fatal—they just mean the graphical shell is blocked from opening the full desktop session under WSLg’s display handling.
